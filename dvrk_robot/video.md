Video pipeline
==============

This describes a fairly low cost setup that can be used with the dVRK/HRSV display (High Resolution Stereo Video).  We use a couple of cheap USB frame grabbers for the analog videos from SD cameras.   For HD systems, we tested a BlackMagic DeckLink Duo with dual SDI inputs.   For displaying the video back, we just use a graphic card with two spare video outputs.  The software relies heavily on ROS tools to grab and display the stereo video.  Some lag is to be expected.

# Hardware

## USB frame grabbers

The frame grabbers we use most often are Hauppage USB Live 2:
 * Manufacturer: http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_usblive2.html
 * Amazon, about $45: http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-610-USB-Live-Digitizer-Capture/dp/B0036VO2BI

When you plug these in your PC, make sure both frame grabbers are on
different USB channels otherwise you won't have enough bandwidth to
capture both left and right videos.  To check, use `lsusb`.  The output should look like:
```sh
$> lsusb
Bus 004 Device 006: ID 0461:4e22 Primax Electronics, Ltd
Bus 004 Device 005: ID 413c:2107 Dell Computer Corp.
Bus 004 Device 004: ID 0424:2514 Standard Microsystems Corp. USB 2.0 Hub
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 2040:c200 Hauppauge
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2040:c200 Hauppauge
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```
In this example, the Hauppage frame grabbers are on bus `004` and `001`.

To check if the frame grabbers are working, one can use `tvtime`
(available on most Linux distributions).  The two frame grabbers
should appear in `/dev` with the prefix `video`.  For example:

```sh
$> ls /dev/video*
/dev/video0  /dev/video1
```

The numbering (i.e. which frame grabber is `/dev/video0` and which one
is `/dev/video1`) depends on the order the grabbers are plugged in.
To have a consistent ordering, always plug the frame grabbers in the
same order, e.g. first the left channel and then the right channel.
To test each channel one after another:

```sh
tvtime -Ld /dev/video0
```
Then:
```sh
tvtime -Ld /dev/video1
```

Once in `tvtime`, change the input to S-Video by pressing `i` key.  If you see a black
image, it's possible that you don't have enough light in front of your
camera or endoscope.  If you happen to use a real da Vinci endoscope
and CCUs (Camera Control Units), you can use the toggle switch
`CAM/BAR` to use the video test pattern
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars).

Using the color bar is also useful to test your video connections,
i.e. if your video is noisy or not visible, put the CCUs in bar mode.
If the video is still not working, the problem likely comes from your
S-video cables.  If the color bars show correctly, the problem comes
from the cables to the endoscope or the endoscope itself.

## Blackmagic DeckLink Duo

You first need to install the drivers from Blackmagic, see https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/capture-and-playback   The drivers are included in the package "Desktop Video".  Once you've downloaded the binaries and extracted the files from Blackmagic, follow the instructions on their ReadMe.txt.   For 64 bits Ubuntu system, install the `.deb` files in subfolder `deb/x86_64`.   If your card is old, the DeckLink install might ask to run the BlackMagic firmware updater, i.e. something like `BlackmagicFirmwareUpdater update 0`.  After you reboot, check with `dmesg | grep -i black` to see if the card is recognized.  If the driver is working properly, the devices will show up under `/dev/blackmagic`.

To test if the drivers are working and the cards are working, use gstreamer 1.0 or greater.  On Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 both gstreamer 1.0 and 0.1 are available.   Make sure you ONLY install the 1.0 packages.   You will also need the proper gstreamer plugins installed:
```sh
  sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad 
```

Once gstreamer is installed, you can use a few command lines to test the drivers:
  * `gst-inspect-1.0 decklinkvideosrc` will show you the different parameters for the Decklink gstreamer plugin
  * `gst-launch-1.0` can be used to launch the streamer and pipe it to see the video live on the computer.   For example, we used `gst-launch-1.0 -v decklinkvideosrc mode=0 connection=sdi device-number=0 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`.
    * `mode=0` is for auto detection and is optional
    * `connection=sdi` is to force to use an SDI input if your card has different types of inputs.  This is optional.
    * `device-number=0` is to select which input to use if you have multiple inputs
  * On a Decklink Duo, we found that one can see the stereo video using two text terminals:
    * `gst-launch-1.0 decklinkvideosrc device-number=0 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`
    * `gst-launch-1.0 decklinkvideosrc device-number=1 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

# Software

## gscam

`gscam` is a ROS node using the `gstreamer` library.  The gstreamer
library supports a few frame grabbers including the Hauppage one.  The
gstreamer developement library can be installed using `apt-get install`.  Make sure you install gstreamer 1.0, not 0.1.

**Important note:** `gscam` binaries provided with ROS kinetic use gstreamer 0.1 so you should **not** install these using `apt`.  Instead, download the source from github and compile in your catkin workspace.  See https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam.  As of March 2018, the readme on gscam/github are a bit confusing since they still indicate that gstreamer 1.x support is experimental but they provide instructions to compile with gstreamer 1.x.   So, make sure you compile for 1.x version.

### ROS Ubuntu packages

Use `apt install` to install gscam!   The package name should be `ros-<distro>-gscam`.   It will install all the required dependencies for you.

### Manual compilation

**This is not recommended anymore, there are now ROS packages for gstreamer, just use them!**

The gscam node is part of ROS Hydro but hasn't made it to ROS Indigo yet (as of March 2016).  If you have ROS Hydro (also Kinetic and Lunar!), use `apt-get` to install it.  If you're using a more recent version of ROS, get the sources from github and build it.  Assuming your Catkin workspace is in `~/catkin` and you're using the Catkin Python build tools:

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam
catkin build
```

### Using gscam

To start the `gscam` node, we provide a couple of ROS launch scripts.

For a stereo system with the USB frame grabbers, use:
```sh
roslaunch dvrk_robot gscam_stereo.launch rig_name:=jhu_daVinci
```
Where `jhu_daVinci` is a name you want to give to your camera rig.  This name will be used to define the ROS namespace for all the data published.  It is also used to define a directory to save the results of your camera calibration or load said camera calibration (i.e. `dvrk_robot/data/<rig_name>`).  If you don't have a calibration for your rig, you can still render both video channels using the ROS topics:
  * `/jhu_daVinci/left/image_raw`
  * `/jhu_daVinci/right/image_raw`

For a system with a Decklink Duo, the `gscam_config` in a launch script would look like:
```xml
    <param name="gscam_config" value="decklinkvideosrc connection=sdi device-number=0 ! videoconvert"/>
```

## (rqt_)image_view

One can use the `image_view` node to visualize a single image:

```sh
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/jhu_daVinci/right/image_raw
```

If you prefer GUI, you can use `rqt_image_view`, a simple program to
view the different camera topics.  Pick the image to display using the
drop-down menu on the top left corner.

## RViz

Use RViz to display both channels at the same time.  Add image, select
topic and then drop image to separate screen/eye on the HRSV display.
You can save your settings to everytime you start RViz you will have
both images.

## Camera calibration

```sh
roslaunch dvrk_robot gscam_stereo.launch rig_name:=jhu_daVinci rect:=false
```

To start the camera calibration:
```
# ros camera calibration
# NOTE: checkerboard 11x10 square with = 5 mm
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 11x10 --square 0.005 right:=/jhu_daVinci/right/image_raw left:=/jhu_daVinci/left/image_raw right_camera:=/jhu_daVinci/right left_camera:=/jhu_daVinci/left --approximate=0.050
```

Save results:
 * manual save: calibration result is located /tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz
 * commit button to save (note camera_info_url should be correct)
 * calibration result is saved as `ost.txt`, which is Videre INI format
 * `gscam` requires calibration file with file extension `.ini` or `.yaml`.
 * `gscam` only takes package://dvrk_robot/data/<rig_name>
 * from now on, use topics `image_rect_color`
